# Decap CMS config.yml builder
Not finished yet!

But this will be a GUI to generate a config.yml for Decap CMS. I'm not affiliated with them by the way. Decap CMS is a headless CMS that is a easy-to-use CMS for end users. It saves all the content within your Git repository. So it is privacy friendly as well. Without a GUI, you would have to generate and edit a config.yml manually in the code. But with a GUI it is more easier. Soon, when it is released, you can generate collections with files and fields, and you can import your current config.yml and make changes.
